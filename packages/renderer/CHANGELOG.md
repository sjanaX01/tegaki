### Patch Changes

- [`b326f00`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/b326f00d52b97ef19e0214cb4595bd31cd501cf4) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add delay and loop gap for uncontrolled animations

- [`1449890`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/144989014c0d9cdbf80fafbb77af646b96065832) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add docs and example for using Tegaki with Remotion. The example is a simple composition that renders a single text prop, but the same principles apply to more complex compositions and dynamic props.

- [`1449890`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/144989014c0d9cdbf80fafbb77af646b96065832) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix rendering when zoom level was not 100%.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/pull/12) [`e43197f`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/e43197f5719368bed5280aa106c8fcb7afe05b4e) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add CDN-friendly font bundles and `createBundle` helper

  - Built font bundles now use `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` instead of bundler-specific import attributes, making them work natively in browsers and on CDN services like esm.sh and jsDelivr
  - Glyph data JSON is inlined in the built output so no import attributes are needed at runtime
  - Added `createBundle()` to `tegaki/core` and `tegaki/wc` for manually assembling a font bundle from fetched glyph data and a font URL

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b0dabe4`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/b0dabe4ede42564ca2fadf68a3db23a94c55d163) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Add Web Components adapter (`tegaki/wc`) with `<tegaki-renderer>` custom element and docs page.

### Patch Changes

- [`4068d1c`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/4068d1c74413e302b73375897aa9377c215a087a) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix user-provided inline styles being overridden by engine root styles in Astro, Svelte, and Solid adapters.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`be540e1`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/be540e13d47804b2068ee111f0297ef4809d6550) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Remove extra wrapper div from TegakiRenderer DOM output. The engine now uses the adapter's container element directly as its root (`data-tegaki="root"`), eliminating a redundant nested div. This fixes CSS-controlled animations where styles applied to the `<TegakiRenderer>` component (like `animation-timeline`) weren't reaching the engine's root element. `renderElements` now returns `{ rootProps, content }` instead of a single element tree.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9288227`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/9288227945a7623158990744809dc7d711536a7a) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Tegaki is framework agnostic now

### Minor Changes

- [`dc581bf`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/dc581bf2e68324ba810c01aea3b7d5c646462a42) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Fix font bundle types and make sure they are assignable to the expected type.

### Minor Changes

- [`2236325`](https://github.com/KurtGokhan/tegaki/commit/2236325c7119b6de47be3f479b3e01b2cae4b907) Thanks [@KurtGokhan](https://github.com/KurtGokhan)! - Rework font loading and improve defaults

  - **Breaking**: Remove `registerFontFace()` from `TegakiBundle`. Font registration is now handled internally by `TegakiRenderer` via the FontFace API.

  - Export `ensureFontFace()` utility for manually preloading a bundle's font.
  - Fix font layout being calculated with wrong font metrics when switching fonts or when the font isn't loaded yet.
  - Enable `pressureWidth` effect by default.
  - Handle non-JS environments (SSR) more gracefully.
